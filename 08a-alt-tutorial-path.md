### Retreat?

Some may have to back up and punt, using this tutorial in mind of the launch being to a local minikube cluster instead.

The tutorial provided at the link above appears to be for creating applications on resources in the cloud and running on GCP instances, not on a local dev machine like a macbookpro. 

We could set up a thin client however and just make requests to that cloud server to do things, but in the mountains and with terrible connectivity that becomes rather cumbersome. Again, welcome to offline mode. This isn't a scripted chaos monkey manifestation of legacy Netflix development procedures either, but I'm sure we all see the ramifications from time to time because of it.
